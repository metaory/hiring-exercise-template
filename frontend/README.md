# Welcome Frontend Product Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  Javascript
FRAMEWORKS: React and any libraries you want
TESTS:      nice to have, but not mandatory
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

# Overview

This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to one of the exercises below in the time allotted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. This is **NOT** a test of how well you know React or ES7+, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .

Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.

# Choose One Of the following

--------------

## Exercise A: Creating an offer

### As a hiring manager I want to

* Create a new offer of employment
  * Specify the monetary compensation details of an offer (salary, equity, bonus, etc)
  * Specify non-monetary compensation and benefits (culture, learning opportunities, etc)
* See a list of the offers I've created
* Share a link to an offer via a unique URL

### As an employee receiving an offer I want to

* View an offer that was sent to me
  * **stretch goal**: Ask a question about the offer (ideally a subsection of the offer)
* Understand the non-salary compensation I am being offered (stock valuation, value of healthcare benefits)
* See detail about the role, team, and organization

## Exercise B: Visualizing Compensation and Benefits

### As a HR-team member I want to

* "Upload" a CSV/JSON file with my the compensation data of my current organization
  * **NOTE**: You don't need to create an API around file storage/IO. Use any/all of the sample files in [/shared/salary_datasets](/shared/salary_datasets) or create your own simple faked data set.
* View the data in a simple tabular view
  * **stretch goal**: be able to sort or search by any unique identifiers (name, email, etc) so I can find specific rows
* View simple visualization(s) of the distribution of salary compensation so I can get an overview/aggregate of overall compensation
  * **stretch goal**: be able to visualize data across more than one dimension
